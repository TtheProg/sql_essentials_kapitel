HOW TO GET THE SCHEMA OF A DATABASE:

In the exercises below you will need to use the clauses you used in the
previous SQL Challenges, plus the following clauses:
    - AS
	- LEFT JOIN
    - RIGHT JOIN
    - INNER JOIN
*/

/* 1. Select the table sales, assigning the alias "s" to it. 
   Select the column ord_num using the syntax "table_alias.column" */

/*******************************************************************************
JOINS

We will only use LEFT, RIGHT, and INNER joins.
You do not need to worry about the other types for now
