SQL CHALLENGES 4

*******************************************************************************
*******************************************************************************

In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
	- LIKE (%, _)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In SQL we can have many databases, they will show up in the schemas list
We must first define which database we will be working with. */

USE publications;

/*******************************************************************************
LIKE

Here we will also learn to use some wild card characters:

(You can ignore 'Wildcard Characters in MS Access'
You need to look at the section 'Wildcard Characters in SQL Server')

/* 1. Select all books from the table title that contain the word "cooking"
   in its title */

SELECT

-- 2. Select all titles that start with the word "The"

SELECT

    title LIKE 'The%';

/* 3. Select the full names (first and last name) of authors whose last name
   starts with "S" */

/* 4. Select the name and address of all stores located in an Avenue
   (its address ends with "Ave.") */

/* 6. Look at the "employee" table (select all columns to explore the raw data):
   Find a pattern that reveals whether an employee is Female or Male.
   Select all female employees. */

/* 8. Select all books that have an "ing" in the title, with at least 4 other
   characters preceding it. For example, 'cooking' has 4 characters before the
   'ing', so this should be included; 'sewing' has only 3 characters before the
   'ing', so this shouldn't be included. */

In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
    - IN (NOT IN)
    - BETWEEN (AND)

*/


/*******************************************************************************
IN

   or Oregon (OR) */

cities Salt Lake City, Ann Arbor, and Oakland. */

SELECT

	city NOT IN ("Salt lake City", "Ann Arbor", "Oakland");

/* The differences between =, LIKE and IN

= :   takes a single value to look for and matches only the exact value.

LIKE: takes a single to look for and allows wildcards (%, _) to match patterns
      in different positions.

IN :  takes many values to look for, such as a list of values, but does not
      work with the wildcards (%, _). */
